## 771. Jewels and Stones

https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

> You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want

## 1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

https://leetcode.com/problems/decompress-run-length-encoded-list/

> We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

> Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a
