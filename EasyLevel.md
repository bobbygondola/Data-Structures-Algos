```
class Solution(object):
    def runningSum(self, nums):
        
    
	    result = []
	    result.append(nums[0])
	    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
		    result.append(result[-1]+nums[i])
	    return result
```


## 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

> Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.
> For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple > > kids can have the greatest number of candies.

```
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        
        high_enough = max(candies) - extraCandies
        return [i >= high_enough for i in candies]
